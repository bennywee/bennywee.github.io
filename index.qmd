Hi! My name is Ben and Iâ€™m a data scientist in Melbourne looking to pivot into software and data engineering. I am interested in (too) many things. I love learning about Bayesian statistics, econometrics and data storytelling through modelling and visualisations. I also love building things with code and working with others to solve problems. 

I have spent the past 5 years working as a data scientist in industry. More recently I have found myself enjoying collaborating closely with data and machine learning engineers - learning about how to build and support production systems (machine learning models as well as data pipelines). I hope to continue doing this as I look to shift my career into the engineering space.

I am currently studying a Masters of Applied Econometrics at Monash University, beginning in 2022 and studying part-time. Previously I completed an Honours degree in Economics from the University of Melbourne. I was also a research and teaching assistant (tutor) in the Economics department, teaching undergraduate classes in statistics and econometrics.

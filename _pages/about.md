Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a data scientist in Melbourne. I am interested in bayesian statistics, economics/econometrics and telling stories with data through modelling and visualisations.

I completed an Honours degree in economics from the University of Melbourne. I was previously a research and teaching assistant (tutor) in the economics department, where I taught undergraduate classes in statistics and econometrics.

I currently work in the telco industry, learning about the demands of data science in a commercial landscape. This blog is to record my learnings at work, musings and side projects. You can contact me using any of the channels on the side.

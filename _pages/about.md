Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a data scientist in Melbourne. I am interested in bayesian statistics, economics/econometrics and telling stories with data through modelling and visualisations.

I recently started a Masters of Applied Econometrics at Monash University, beginning in 2022 and studying part-time. Previously I completed an Honours degree in Economics from the University of Melbourne. I was also a research and teaching assistant (tutor) in the Economics department, teaching undergraduate classes in statistics and econometrics. 

I currently work as a data scientist in industry, learning about the demands of data science in a commercial landscape. This blog is to record my learnings at work, musings and side projects. You can contact me using any of the channels on the side.

My name is Ben and I'm a data scientist based in Melbourne. I am interested in bayesian statistics, economics/econometrics and telling stories with data through modelling and visualisations.

I earned an Honours degree in economics from the University of Melbourne. I was previously a research and teaching assistant (tutor) in the economics department, where I taught undergraduate classes in statistics and econometrics.

This blog is to document my learnings and projects as I progress through the world of "data science". Constructive comments, thoughts and criticisms are welcome. I hope to learn by interacting with the rest of the world and in turn, I hope you gain something out of it too.

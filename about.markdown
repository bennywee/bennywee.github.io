My name is Ben and I'm a data scientist in Melbourne. I am interested in bayesian statistics, economics/econometrics and telling stories with data through modelling and visualisations.

I completed an Honours degree in economics from the University of Melbourne. I was previously a research and teaching assistant (tutor) in the economics department, where I taught undergraduate classes in statistics and econometrics.

Currently I am working as a data scientist in the telco industry, learning about the demands of data scientists as a profession and expectations within a commercial landscape. I intend to document my learnings coming from a social science background in future blog posts -- what I wish I learned before starting work, what I actually learned and the varying perceptions of what statistics, data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence means to different people.

This blog is to document my learnings and projects as I progress through the world of "data science". Constructive comments, thoughts and criticisms are welcome. I hope to learn by interacting with the rest of the world and in turn, I hope you gain something out of it too.
